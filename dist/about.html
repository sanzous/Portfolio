                <p>Having worked in multiple challenging fields the past decade has built a sense of excitement
                    in me when given a challenge. Jumping into programming has lit
                    that fire in me even more. Every project or task is a new challenge or problem to solve that excited
                    me.

                    My name is Leonard Canastra. I am a Software Engineer that loves a
                    challenge and has found his calling in Tech. Everyday I aim for
                    newer heights and bigger challenges. I have 10 years of experience
                    in a manufacturing and construction environment following standard operation procedures,
                    working in big teams full of diverse people and ensuring that all
                    the processes run at peak performance everyday. I have helped lower
                    waste in processes in every area I have worked in and increase efficency in the workflow. I now use
                    these
                    skills everyday in my Software Development processes.</p>

                <p>At Mckee Foods I worked in many different process positions. Each one required me to always look for
                    ways to cut waste
                    in processes and find ways to increase efficency. Through this I was able to save the company 3% in
