How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SaSS/ScSS





Tech used basic HTML and SaSS/ScSS as a way to practice my learning of CSS preprocessing. I used javascript minimally for the hamburger menu. The site has also been optimized for mobile view with a dedicated mobile SCSS file for different screen sizes. 





Optimizations
Add some animations to the pages to make each page more visually appealing. Attempt to make a one-page site instead of having multiple pages by using full-screen page transitions.





Lessons Learned:
Doing this project allowed me to solidify my learning of SaSS/SCSS. I learned more about how to ensure that different screen sizes look good by including media queries.
